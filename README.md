The game challenges players to repeat an ever-growing sequence of colors and sounds, testing memory and focus. Features include sequence generation, smooth animations, sound feedback, input validation, and restart functionality. This project demonstrates strong use of **DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic implementation**.
